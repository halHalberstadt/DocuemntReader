# DocumentReader
Reads basic text documents and parses for their questions.
This will eventually be able to read less common files like PDF and spreadsheets for questions

# NOTE
This is just to keep record of my progress on this application, but is not it's own project. This will eventually make it's way onto another project which I will link here once this has a working version
